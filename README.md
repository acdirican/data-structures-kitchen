# Implementation of Data Structures

Data Structures is a crucial topics for computer science and engineering. It is the first step of problem solving and high perforamance computing.  

In this project, I present generic implementations of several important data stuructures in JAVA. 

Implementations does not only include the bare coding of the required algorithms but also  nice class hierarchies, test classes and several interesting methods, including printing, toString, range finding, etc.
